Sadiqs Thing
============

  P(A ∩ B^) ∪ P(A ∩ B)
= P(A) ∩ P(B^ ∪ B) - by distributivity of intersection over union
= P(A) ∩ 1 - by Law of excluded middle
= P(A)

De Morgans Law.
===============

   P(A^ ∩ B^)
 = P((Ω - A) ∩ (Ω - B)) -- by complement elimination
 = P(Ω - (A ∪ B)) -- by complement identify
 = P((A ∪ B)^)

P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)
P(A ∩ B) = P(A|B) * P(B)
